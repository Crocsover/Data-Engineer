# Sales Data Preprocessing Documentation
**Overview**
This documentation provides an overview of the Sales Data Preprocessing project, focusing on the cleaning and enhancement of a sample sales dataset. The primary goal is to prepare the data for comprehensive analysis, ensuring its quality and readiness for data-driven decision-making in the domain of sales.

**Project Structure**

-The project is structured into several key sets of tasks, each addressing specific aspects of data preprocessing. The following sections outline the objectives and techniques employed at each stage.

**Objectives**

-The main objectives of the Sales Data Preprocessing project include:

**Data Cleaning:**

-Address and resolve missing values in critical fields.

-Handle outliers to prevent skewed insights.

**Data Transformation:**

-Standardize data types for consistency.

-Convert categorical variables to a uniform format.

**Data Enrichment:**

-Explore and integrate additional data sources to enhance the dataset.

-Perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

-Conduct EDA to uncover sales trends, patterns, and potential insights.

-Visualize key performance indicators for quick insights.

# Specific Tasks
**Task 1:** Initial Characterization
Give an initial characterization of the entire dataframe.

**Task 2:** Remove Duplicate Rows
Remove duplicate row values from the dataset.

**Task 3:** Express Price in Thousands
Transform the price column to express values in thousands.

**Task 4:** Select Data for Specific Criteria
Select and store in _**empty.csv:**_ Name, city, state, and country data of product 1 bought by customers from the United States and paid through Amex or Diners.
Select and store in **_empty1.csv:_** Name, price, city, state, and country data of product 2 bought by customers from New York and paid through Mastercard.

# Key Steps

**Load Sample Sales Data:**

Import the sample sales dataset into the preprocessing environment.

**Handle Missing Values:**

Identify and address missing values in relevant fields.

**Manage Outliers:**

Implement statistical techniques to detect and handle outliers.

**Standardize Data Types:**

Ensure consistency in data types for seamless analysis.

**Customer Segmentation:**

Utilize clustering techniques to segment customers based on behavior.

**Integrate Additional Data:**

Incorporate external data sources to enrich the sales dataset.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Conduct exploratory analysis to derive valuable insights.

# Conclusion
Upon completion of the Sales Data Preprocessing project, the refined dataset will serve as a reliable foundation for meaningful analytics and informed decision-making within the sales domain.
